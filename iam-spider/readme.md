Version 1 of a python program that spiderwebs out similar to Bloodhound but for blue teams to determine user permission levels. 0-1000 with Global admins in Azure being 1000.

Versions for AWS, AD and other IAM systems to come in future versions along with a GUI.

Currently I have no way of testing this as I do not have a test environment to test this out in.
